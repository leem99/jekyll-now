## Traveling to Parts Unknown: Project Fletcher

The fourth Metis project, known as project Fletcher was open ended. The only requirment was that it involve natural language processing [(NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing). NLP is the processing of human generated text or speech by computers in order to do something useful. Applications for NLP are seemingly endless; they range from spam filters to dictation software. NLP even frequently used in online recommendation systems. 

For me this was an exciting new world. For my entire professional career I've built models that take in continuous numeric inputs and return numeric outputs.
