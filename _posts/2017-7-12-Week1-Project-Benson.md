# Full Speed Ahead

## General Thoughts

* Bootcamp title is appropriate. (Definitely not a data science retreat!)
  * Very fast passed. However, I've been able to keep up (being very dedicated).
  * Workload, feels a little like finals week in gradschool.
  * Thusfar, the curriculum has been well thought out. 
* Impressed by the availability of instructors
  * Two instructors and one TA present from 9:30 until 6:00 pm
* Impressed by the quality of students. 
  * Everyone is friendly. Collabrative atmosphere
  * Very smart.
  * range of academic and professional experiances
  * many traveled to SF just for this bootcamp.
  
## Project Benson
  
* Use New York City MTA turntile data.
* Original problem statement was to use the data to help a fictitious non-profit called WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) 
to optimially place street canvassers for gathering signatures.
* In order to keep it interesting we were encouraged to tweak the problem statement such that:
  * mix it up and 
  * different teams analyze data differently and find different trends. 
* My team decided to help a fictitious food cart chain __The Brothers Falafel__ optimally place food carts in order to maximize revenue. 
* We had a lot of fun with this project.
  * Looked at which stations were the busiest at dinner and lunch.
  * At the busiest stations, which turnstiles were most trafficed. 
  * Inspired by an episod of [*Seinfeld*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFE9C7BBkTY) 
  tried to identify the busiest platforms, in case our client wanted to expand into the trackside halal cart market.
* The [MTA dataset](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) is very messy. 
We Quickly learned that a large part of data science is obtaining and cleaning datasets.
  * Turnstiles counters periodically reset. 
  * There are several stations with identical names. 
* Once again, very fast pace. Went from going over Python, Pandas, git to a finished project in less than a week. Finished our analysis an hour before presenting.
